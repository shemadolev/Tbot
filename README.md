# Tbot
During my first year at the computer science faculty at the Technion institute of technology I felt that there is something missing,
There is a lot of different usefull sites and groups for each course, 
but there is no place to gather them together.
While searching for a solution I Learned about telegram bots.
To make it free to use for everyone I used google javascript platforme. 
I published the project on 20 October 2019 and there is already more than 900 users since.
I hope to develop the bot and to add more feachers.
